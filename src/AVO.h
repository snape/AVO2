 * \details    We present an approach for collision avoidance for mobile robots
 *             that takes into account acceleration constraints. We discuss both
 *             the case of navigating a single robot among moving obstacles, and
 *             the case of multiple robots reciprocally avoiding collisions with
 *             each other while navigating a common workspace. Inspired by the
 *             concept of velocity obstacles, we introduce the
 *             acceleration-velocity obstacle to let a robot avoid collisions
 *             with moving obstacles while obeying acceleration constraints. AVO
 *             characterizes the set of new velocities the robot can safely
 *             reach and adopt using proportional control of the acceleration.
 *             We extend this concept to reciprocal collision avoidance for
 *             multi-robot settings, by letting each robot take half of the
 *             responsibility of avoiding pairwise collisions. Our formulation
 *             guarantees collision-free navigation even as the robots act
 *             independently and simultaneously, without coordination. Our
 *             approach is designed for holonomic robots, but can also be
 *             applied to kinematically constrained non-holonomic robots such as
 *             cars. We have implemented our approach, and we show simulation
 *             results in challenging environments with large numbers of robots
 *             and obstacles.
